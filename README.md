# Project Title

Experiment Scrapper Testing Ground

## First Time Setup

The first step to running Spectrum locally is downloading the code by cloning the repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:withspectrum/spectrum.git
```

If you get `Permission denied` error using `ssh` use `https` link as a fallback.

```
git clone https://github.com/entrptaher/experiment-scraper-testing-ground.git
```
