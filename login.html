					Often in order to reach the desired information you need to be logged
					in to the website. Most of today's websites use so-called form-based
					authentication which implies sending user credentials using POST
					method, authenticating it on the server and storing user's session in
					a cookie.

				<p class="mb-16">
					This simple test shows scraper's ability to:
				</p>

				<ol class="list mb-16">
					<li>Send user credentials via POST method</li>
					<li>Receive, Keep and Return a session cookie</li>
					<li>Process HTTP redirect (302)></li>
				</ol>

				<p class="mb-16">
					How to test:
				</p>

				<ol class="list">
					<li>
						Enter <b>admin</b> and <b>12345</b> in the form below and press
						<b>Login</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						If you see <span class="success">WELCOME</span> :) then the user
						credentials were sent, the cookie was passed and HTTP redirect was
						processed
					</li>
					<li>
						If you see <span class="danger">ACCESS DENIED!</span> then either
						you entered wrong credentials or they were not sent to the server
						properly
					</li>
					<li>
						If you see
						<span class="danger"
							>THE SESSION COOKIE IS MISSING OR HAS A WRONG VALUE!</span
						>
						then the user credentials were properly sent but the session cookie
						was not properly stored or passed
					</li>
					<li>
						If you see <span class="success">REDIRECTING...</span> then the user
						credentials were properly sent but HTTP redirection was not
						processed
					</li>
					<li>Click <b>GO BACK</b> to start again</li>
				</ol>
