        Often in order to reach the desired information you need to be logged in
        to the website. Most of today's websites use so-called form-based
        authentication which implies sending user credentials using POST method,
        authenticating it on the server and storing user's session in a cookie.
        <p></p>
        <p>This simple test shows scraper's ability to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Send user credentials via POST method</li>
          <li>Receive, Keep and Return a session cookie</li>
          <li>Process HTTP redirect (302)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>How to test:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Enter <b>admin</b> and <b>12345</b> in the form below and press
            <b>Login</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you see <span class="success">WELCOME :)</span> then the user
            credentials were sent, the cookie was passed and HTTP redirect was
            processed
          </li>
          <li>
            If you see <span class="error">ACCESS DENIED!</span> then either you
            entered wrong credentials or they were not sent to the server
            properly
          </li>
          <li>
            If you see
            <span class="error"
              >THE SESSION COOKIE IS MISSING OR HAS A WRONG VALUE!</span
            >
            then the user credentials were properly sent but the session cookie
            was not properly stored or passed
          </li>
          <li>
            If you see <span class="success">REDIRECTING...</span> then the user
            credentials were properly sent but HTTP redirection was not
            processed
          </li>
          <li>Click <b>GO BACK</b> to start again</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
